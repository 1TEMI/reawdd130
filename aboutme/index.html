    <h2>Igwe Emmanuel</h2>
    <p>My name is Igwe Emmanuel, I am from Nigeria and I am studying Applied Technology.</p>
    <p>I am excited to be here to learn and share ideas with you all. Aside learning, I love watching movies especially comedy movies and shows, I also love video games. I remember when I started my first programming course (Intro to Programming) I was sacred and worried because I didn't have any prior knowledge in programming but I'm glad I didn't let that discourage me, I have made so much progress in programming and this is my third programming course since I started my degree program. I always feel grateful for how far I have come and the knowledge and experience I have gained in my educational journey. I am going to apply the same principle of courage and determination for this course as we learn and progress together.</p>
    <p>Thank you for looking at my web page.</p>
    <p>Have a nice day!</p>
